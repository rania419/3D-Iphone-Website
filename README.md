🌟 Project-Based Learning
This project is part of a project-based learning journey where I applied and deepened my knowledge in the following technologies and skills:

React: For building dynamic and reactive user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: To create responsive and modern UI design quickly using utility-first CSS.
React Three.js: For rendering and interacting with 3D elements and scenes.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): To add high-performance animations for a smooth user experience.
Through this hands-on project, I strengthened my skills by implementing real-world techniques and solving common front-end development challenges.

🚀 Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
React Three.js: A React renderer for three.js, used for 3D models and scenes.
GSAP: GreenSock Animation Platform for creating smooth animations and transitions.
